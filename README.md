## Introduction ✏️
Math-Info project carried out in 2019, as part of studies in the engineering preparatory cycle. The aim of the project is to reduce the size of the files, as much as possible, as desired using the Huffman method.

All scripts are written in UTF-8, the docstring and comments are in UTF-8
comply with the standard [_PEP 484_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) as follows
than the standard for Docstrings [_Google_](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

All the libraries used are native.


## Objectives ✔️
Implement a compression algorithm, recursively, reducing the size of the files. With the Huffman method.
#### Bonus 🥉
It is possible to decompress previously compressed files. Always by the Huffman method.

## Start the program 🏁

To do this, open the ``Main.py`` file in a terminal.
A graphical window opens :
